# ðŸš€ TODO Tagging Strategy for Better Code Organization

Using specific tags in TODO comments helps in better organization, readability, and tracking of pending tasks in a
project. Below is a structured approach to tagging TODOs effectively.

```
TODO: [OPTIMIZATION] Reduce memory usage in large datasets.
TODO: [OPTIMIZATION] Refactor this function to improve performance.
TODO: [OPTIMIZATION] Optimize database queries to reduce execution time.
```

### 2. Security ([SECURITY])

Tasks related to securing the system, preventing attacks, and enhancing authentication mechanisms.

```
TODO: [SECURITY] Implement input validation to prevent SQL injection.
TODO: [SECURITY] Add authentication to protect this endpoint.

### 4. Bug Fix ([BUGFIX])

Tasks for fixing known issues, errors, and unexpected behaviors.

```
TODO: [BUGFIX] Fix session expiration issue when user logs out.
TODO: [BUGFIX] Resolve race condition in concurrent requests.

TODO: [DOCS] Write API documentation for this endpoint.
TODO: [DOCS] Update README with configuration instructions.
```

### 7. Testing ([TEST])

Tasks for writing or improving unit tests, integration tests, and increasing test coverage.

```
TODO: [TEST] Add unit tests for this function.
TODO: [TEST] Write integration tests for new API endpoints.
TODO: [TEST] Ensure at least 80% test coverage for this module.
```

### 8. Deprecation ([DEPRECATION])

Tasks related to removing old, unused, or outdated code and dependencies.

```
TODO: [DEPRECATION] Remove this legacy function in version 2.0.
TODO: [DEPRECATION] Migrate from deprecated API to the new version.
TODO: [DEPRECATION] Replace usage of this outdated library.
```

### 9. Dependency Management ([DEPENDENCY])
