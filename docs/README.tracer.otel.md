### The key difference between these two code snippets lies in the communication protocol and the mechanism for sending trace data to Jaeger.

#### Different:

1. OTLP Exporter (otlptracehttp.New)

   This snippet uses the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP).

   **Features:**

    - Standard OpenTelemetry Protocol:
        - OTLP is an open standard protocol for sending trace, metrics, and logs data to various backends.

    - Highly Flexible:
        - OTLP allows you to send data to any OTLP-compatible service (e.g., Jaeger, Prometheus, DataDog, etc.).

    - Ports:
        - It typically uses port 4317 (for gRPC) or 4318 (for HTTP).

    - Advantages:
        - Suitable for environments using OpenTelemetry standards.
        - Supports data transmission over both gRPC and HTTP.

    - Disadvantages:
        - Requires proper OTLP configuration in the destination service (e.g., Jaeger).
        - Initial setup may be slightly more complex.
        ```go
        exp, err := otlptracehttp.New(context.Background(),
        otlptracehttp.WithEndpoint(cfg.OTLPEndpoint), // Jaeger or OTLP-compatible endpoint
        otlptracehttp.WithInsecure(), // No TLS required
        )
        ``` 

2. Jaeger Exporter (jaeger.New), [Deprecated]

   This snippet uses Jaeger’s native API to send trace data directly to the Jaeger collector or agent.

   **Features:**

    - Direct Connection to Jaeger:
        - Sends trace data using Jaeger Thrift or gRPC protocols directly to Jaeger services.

    - Ports:
        - Typically uses ports like 14268 (Collector) or 6831 (Agent).

    - Advantages:
        - Simpler to use if Jaeger is your only backend.
        - No need to configure OTLP in Jaeger.

    - Disadvantages:
        - Limited to Jaeger and not easily transferable to other systems.
        - Doesn’t support newer standards like OTLP.
      ```go
      exp, err := jaeger.New(
      jaeger.WithCollectorEndpoint(
      jaeger.WithEndpoint(cfg.CollectorEndpoint), // Jaeger collector endpoint
      ),
      )
      ```

#### Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
  jaeger:
    container_name: container_jaeger
    restart: always
    image: jaegertracing/all-in-one:1.63.0
    environment:
      - COLLECTOR_OTLP_ENABLED=true
      - COLLECTOR_ZIPKIN_HTTP_PORT=9411
    ports:
      - 16686:16686   # Jaeger UI port
      - 14268:14268   # accept jaeger.thrift directly from clients
      - 14250:14250   # accept model.proto
      - 4317:4317     # accept OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) over gRPC
      - 4318:4318     # accept OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) over HTTP
      - 9411:9411     # Zipkin compatible endpoint (optional)

    networks:
      - name_network
```

The `COLLECTOR_OTLP_ENABLED=true` environment variable is a configuration setting for Jaeger, specifically for its
all-in-one image. Here's what it does:

- Purpose

  The COLLECTOR_OTLP_ENABLED=true setting enables OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) support in the Jaeger collector. This
  allows Jaeger to receive telemetry data (e.g., traces) sent via the OTLP protocol.


- Why is it needed?

  By default, the Jaeger all-in-one image supports its own protocols like Thrift. To support OTLP, which is the
  standard
  protocol used by OpenTelemetry, you must explicitly enable it with this variable.

    - OLTP (OpenTelemetry Protocol) is widely used by OpenTelemetry SDKs to export traces, metrics, and logs.
    - Without COLLECTOR_OTLP_ENABLED=true, Jaeger will not listen for OTLP traffic, and applications using OTLP
      exporters (
      e.g., OTLP/gRPC or OTLP/HTTP) will fail to connect to Jaeger.

#### Trace vs Logging

**The key difference between tracing and logging lies in their purpose and scope:**

- Tracing provides a distributed view of how a single request flows through different components in your system,
  focusing
  on performance monitoring and latency analysis.
- Logging captures detailed information about the state and behavior of the application at specific points, mainly for
  debugging and error analysis.

If you store information about the database, queue, cache, and other dependencies in the logger, there is no need to add
this information again in the tracing system unless you want it to be tracked as part of the tracing data.

**Here are two key points:**

- Separation of Concerns:

    - Logging: Typically used to capture general system-level information, such as request details, errors, and system
      status.
      This information is usually useful for troubleshooting and debugging.

    - Trace: Primarily used to track the flow of a request from start to finish in a distributed system. This data
      can include
      metadata that helps in analyzing performance, delays, and dependencies between services.


- Redundancy:

  If you're logging information like the type of database, cache, queue, and other dependencies, and you're generally
  tracking the status of requests and system performance, there may be no need to repeat this data in tracing.
  However, if you want to know when and how a request interacts with a specific database or queue, adding this
  information
  to tracing can be useful to track the exact path of requests.

**Recommendation:**

In Logging: Log key information such as the status of interactions with databases, queues, and caches.
In Trace: Record information necessary to trace each request in a distributed system, such as timings, dependencies
between services, and specific metadata for each transaction.
This allows you to leverage both tools effectively without duplicating unnecessary information.
