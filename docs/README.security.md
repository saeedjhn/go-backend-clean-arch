# Security Attack Mitigation Recommendations

## 1. SQL Injection Attacks

- **Suggested solution**: To prevent SQL injection, you should use **parameterized queries** or **ORMs** to ensure that
  malicious data does not enter SQL queries.
- **Recommendation**: Use libraries like `sqlx` or `gorm` to prevent SQL injection.

## 2. CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) Attacks

- **Suggested solution**: To defend against CSRF, you need to use **CSRF tokens**, which are sent with each request. The
  server should validate the token before processing the request.
- **Recommendation**: Use middleware that manages CSRF tokens.

## 3. Brute Force Attacks

- **Suggested solution**: To prevent brute force attacks, you should implement **rate limiting** and use secure
  authentication protocols like **JWT** and **OAuth**.
- **Recommendation**: Use tools like `rate-limiter` and enable **two-factor authentication (2FA)**.

## 4. DoS / DDoS Attacks

- **Suggested solution**: To defend against DoS and DDoS attacks, use **firewall solutions** and **rate limiting**, or
  use DDoS protection services like **Cloudflare**.
- **Recommendation**: Use DDoS protection services such as **Cloudflare** or **AWS Shield**.

## 5. Directory Traversal Attacks

- **Reason it's not suitable**: These attacks are designed to access system files through user inputs and are unrelated
  to content sanitization.
- **Suggested solution**: To prevent this, ensure that user inputs are restricted to safe file paths and use secure path
  handling.
- **Recommendation**: Use tools to limit file access and avoid processing user inputs in sensitive directories.

## 6. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks

- **Suggested solution**: To protect against MITM attacks, you should use **SSL/TLS encryption** to ensure data is
  transmitted securely.
- **Recommendation**: Use **HTTPS** for all communications.

## 7. XSS Attacks Based on Non-HTML Inputs (e.g., JavaScript URLs)

- **Suggested solution**: Use additional mechanisms to inspect inputs and block JavaScript code injection in URLs.
- **Recommendation**: Thoroughly validate inputs and filter URLs separately.
