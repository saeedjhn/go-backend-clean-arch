# Security Attack Mitigation Recommendations

## 1. SQL Injection Attacks

- **Reason it's not suitable**: `bluemonday` is specifically designed to protect against XSS attacks and does not
  prevent SQL injection.
- **Suggested solution**: To prevent SQL injection, you should use **parameterized queries** or **ORMs** to ensure that
  malicious data does not enter SQL queries.
- **Recommendation**: Use libraries like `sqlx` or `gorm` to prevent SQL injection.

## 2. CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) Attacks

- **Reason it's not suitable**: `bluemonday` does not play a role in protecting against CSRF attacks.
- **Suggested solution**: To defend against CSRF, you need to use **CSRF tokens**, which are sent with each request. The
  server should validate the token before processing the request.
- **Recommendation**: Use middleware that manages CSRF tokens.

## 3. Brute Force Attacks

- **Reason it's not suitable**: `bluemonday` does not impact brute force attacks, as these attacks typically aim to
  break passwords.
- **Suggested solution**: To prevent brute force attacks, you should implement **rate limiting** and use secure
  authentication protocols like **JWT** and **OAuth**.
- **Recommendation**: Use tools like `rate-limiter` and enable **two-factor authentication (2FA)**.

## 4. DoS / DDoS Attacks

- **Reason it's not suitable**: DoS and DDoS attacks mainly aim to flood the server with unnecessary requests, and
  `bluemonday` doesn't help in this area.
- **Suggested solution**: To defend against DoS and DDoS attacks, use **firewall solutions** and **rate limiting**, or
  use DDoS protection services like **Cloudflare**.
- **Recommendation**: Use DDoS protection services such as **Cloudflare** or **AWS Shield**.

## 5. Directory Traversal Attacks

- **Reason it's not suitable**: These attacks are designed to access system files through user inputs and are unrelated
  to content sanitization.
- **Suggested solution**: To prevent this, ensure that user inputs are restricted to safe file paths and use secure path
  handling.
- **Recommendation**: Use tools to limit file access and avoid processing user inputs in sensitive directories.

## 6. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks

- **Reason it's not suitable**: MITM attacks involve intercepting or altering data during transmission, and `bluemonday`
  doesn't address these kinds of attacks.
- **Suggested solution**: To protect against MITM attacks, you should use **SSL/TLS encryption** to ensure data is
  transmitted securely.
- **Recommendation**: Use **HTTPS** for all communications.

## 7. XSS Attacks Based on Non-HTML Inputs (e.g., JavaScript URLs)

- **Reason it's not suitable**: Although `bluemonday` is effective at preventing XSS in HTML content, it might not fully
  address cases such as JavaScript URLs in inputs.
- **Suggested solution**: Use additional mechanisms to inspect inputs and block JavaScript code injection in URLs.
- **Recommendation**: Thoroughly validate inputs and filter URLs separately.

### Conclusion:

While `bluemonday` is an excellent tool for preventing **XSS attacks**, it is not sufficient to protect against other
types of attacks such as SQL Injection, CSRF, Brute Force, DoS/DDoS, Directory Traversal, MITM, or certain types of
XSS (e.g., through JavaScript URLs). For comprehensive security, you should use other security measures and libraries
tailored for each specific attack vector.
