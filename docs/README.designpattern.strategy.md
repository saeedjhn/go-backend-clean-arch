## Strategy Pattern Components

- **Context:** Represents the entity that uses different strategies.
- **Strategy Interface:** An interface that defines the method signature that all concrete strategies must implement.
- **Concrete Strategies:** A set of structs/classes that implement the Strategy Interface.

### Summary

**To summarize, the strategy pattern is a strong design pattern that allows for the selection and swapping of algorithms
at runtime. You can create flexible, maintainable, and extensible code by defining a common strategy interface,
implementing concrete strategies, and managing these strategies within a context.**
